# Fuzzy Playground üëæ

An evolving environment to play, experiment and learn about web graphics and user interfaces

**What does that even mean ?**

Its basically a web application that uses Svelte to handle the state management necessary to run and interact with WebGL examples given as part of the https://webglfundamentals.org/ tutorial.

The app displays a canvas, a feedback area (displayed only when there are errors in the code), and provides some controls:

- üëæ a Play button
- üßΩ a Reset button (reset current animation)
- üöø a Refresh button (reloads the page for now)
- an Animations menu
- inputs for 2D coordinates (for now)

You can play with it here:

**Is that all??**

Yes, for now =)

The development is tied to my learning WebGL, which is why it's evolving, and a playground.
I also take some time to learn Svelte & Sapper as I go along.

If I don't end up fedup by all the emojis, I might continue to use the same setup for experimenting with other interactive graphics libraries that make use of the Canvas element

## Getting started

src: [Sapper template](https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper-template) README

### Running the project

However you get the code, you can install dependencies and run the project in development mode with:

```bash
npm install # or yarn
npm run dev
```

Open up [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and start clicking around.
Consult [sapper.svelte.dev](https://sapper.svelte.dev) for help getting started.

## TODO

- Get back to the WebGL bits!
- Explore how to use Svelte better
