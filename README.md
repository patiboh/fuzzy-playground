# Fuzzy Playground ðŸ‘¾

An evolving environment to play, experiment and learn about web graphics and user interfaces

**What does that even mean ?**

Its basically a web application that uses Svelte to handle the state management necessary to run and interact with WebGL exercices in https://webglfundamentals.org/, as well as to turn errors into visual feedback on screen rather than logs in the console (+ totally overkill emoji love)

The app displays a canvas, a feedback area (displayed only when there are errors in the code), and provides some controls:

* a Play button
* a Refresh button (reloads the page for now)
* a "Clear emojis button" (to stop the emojis)
* inputs for 2D coordinates (for now)

**Is that all??**

Yes, for now =)

The development is tied to my learning WebGL, which is why it's evolving, and a playground.
I also take some time to learn Svelte & Sapper as I go along.

If I don't end up fedup by all the emojis, I might continue to use the same setup for experimenting with other interactive graphics libraries that make use of the Canvas element

## Libraries & Resources:

* [Sapper](https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper) (mainly because I wanted to do TDD using Cucumber - this has proven more challenging than I expected)
* [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)
* [Svelte tutorial](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/basics): the best intro to Svelte, and source of the emoji animations
* WebGL examples from https://webglfundamentals.org/

## Getting started

### Running the project

However you get the code, you can install dependencies and run the project in development mode with:

```bash
npm install # or yarn
npm run dev
```

Open up [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and start clicking around.
Consult [sapper.svelte.dev](https://sapper.svelte.dev) for help getting started.
