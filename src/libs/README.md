# Notes on WebGL Fundamentals tutorials

The files in this folder contain mostly code examples, notes or libraries taken from the following website:

https://webglfundamentals.org

If you're looking for information on WebGL, and you haven't yet visited that site, I recommend you go there first.

To run this code on your local machine, you can run a [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) server inside this folder

`python -m http.server`
